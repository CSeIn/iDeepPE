  To demonstrate the performance of the proposed iDeepPE under the presence of unseen noises, we have conducted an additional experiment on the clean speech in the CHiME-4 simulated dataset mixed with different types of noises comparing DeepPE, DeepPE+DPConformer, and iDeepPE. 
  The environmental noise in each file included a diffuse noise and one directional noise.
  Details of the unseen noise experiment are as follows:
  - Diffuse noise: generated from one of the 4 types of noises (kitchen, meeting room, office, and park) in the DEMAND dataset [R4] using the arbitrary noise field generator [R5]
  - Directional noise: competing speech selected from the VCTK corpus [R6] convolved with the room impulse responses generated by pyroomacoustics [R7]
    - Simulated room configuration
      - Room size [W, L, H]: [2.5-5m, 3-9m, 2.2-3.5m] 
      - RT60: 0.3-0.5s 
      - Mic. position: random position in the xy plane but at least 1m away from the walls and at fixed height of 1.5m 
      - Directional source position: minimun distance of 1m from the center of the microphone array, ensuring at least a 30˚ angular separation from the target source
  - Overall SNR range: approximately 1-7dB
    - SNRs for diffuse noises: 3, 6, 9 dB
    - SNRs for directional noises: 6, 9, 12 dB
  - Total generated samples: 2,340
